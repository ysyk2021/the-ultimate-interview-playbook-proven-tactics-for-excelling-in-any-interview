Strategies for Staying Top-of-Mind with Hiring Managers
====================================================================================================

Following up after an interview is a critical step in the job search process. In addition to thanking the interviewer and requesting feedback, it's important to stay top-of-mind with hiring managers. In this chapter, we'll explore strategies for doing just that.

Send a Thank-You Note
---------------------

Sending a thank-you note after an interview is not only polite, but it can also keep you top-of-mind with hiring managers. A well-written note can leave a positive impression and show that you're serious about the role.

Connect on LinkedIn
-------------------

Connect with the interviewer or hiring manager on LinkedIn after the interview. This can help you stay connected and engaged with the company, as well as make it easier for them to reach out to you in the future.

Share Relevant Content
----------------------

If you come across an article or piece of content that's relevant to the company or the industry, share it on LinkedIn and tag the interviewer or hiring manager. This shows that you're interested and engaged in their work and can help keep you top-of-mind.

Provide Updates
---------------

If your job search leads to other interviews or job offers, reach out to the interviewer to let them know. This shows that you're in demand and can make you a more attractive candidate.

Follow-up Regularly
-------------------

Don't be afraid to follow-up regularly with the interviewer or hiring manager, but do so in a polite and professional manner. Checking in periodically can help keep you top-of-mind without coming across as pushy.

Attend Company Events
---------------------

If the company hosts events or webinars, attend them and engage with the presenters and attendees. This can help you stay engaged with the company and showcase your interest in the industry.

Conclusion
----------

Staying top-of-mind with hiring managers after an interview is important for staying in consideration for the role and future opportunities. Sending a thank-you note, connecting on LinkedIn, sharing relevant content, providing updates, following-up regularly, and attending company events are all effective strategies for doing so. By staying engaged and showing your interest in the company and industry, you increase your chances of landing the job.
