Your nonverbal cues play a significant role in how you are perceived during an interview. They can convey confidence, engagement, and professionalism or inadvertently send signals of nervousness or disinterest. In this chapter, we will explore tactics for controlling your own nonverbal cues to excel in any interview.

Cultivate a Confident Posture
-----------------------------

* **Stand Tall**: Maintain an upright posture to exude confidence and presence. Avoid slouching or hunching over, as it can convey a lack of self-assurance.
* **Sit Straight**: Sit comfortably but attentively, with your back straight and shoulders relaxed. This posture shows that you are engaged and focused on the conversation.

Maintain Appropriate Eye Contact
--------------------------------

* **Establish Connection**: Make consistent eye contact with the interviewer(s) to establish a connection and convey interest in the conversation.
* **Avoid Staring**: Strike a balance between maintaining eye contact and avoiding excessive staring. Blink naturally and occasionally look away to avoid making the interviewer uncomfortable.

Use Facial Expressions Effectively
----------------------------------

* **Smile Genuinely**: Use a genuine and warm smile to express friendliness, enthusiasm, and approachability. However, be mindful of aligning the intensity of your smile with the context of the conversation.
* **Show Interest**: Display active listening through facial expressions such as nodding, raising eyebrows, and maintaining an engaged and attentive expression.

Gesture with Purpose
--------------------

* **Use Hand Gestures**: Utilize purposeful hand gestures to enhance your verbal communication and emphasize key points. However, ensure that your gestures are natural and not distracting.
* **Avoid Excessive Movement**: Be mindful of excessive fidgeting or repetitive movements, as they can indicate nervousness or lack of focus. Maintain controlled and purposeful movements.

Regulate Voice Tone and Volume
------------------------------

* **Speak Clearly**: Articulate your words clearly and ensure your voice is audible to the interviewer(s). Avoid mumbling or speaking too softly, as it may convey a lack of confidence.
* **Vary Your Tone**: Use appropriate variations in your voice tone to convey enthusiasm, emphasis on important points, or convey different emotions when sharing stories or experiences.

Manage Nervous Habits
---------------------

* **Identify Nervous Habits**: Be aware of any nervous habits you may have, such as biting your nails, tapping your foot, or playing with objects. These can distract the interviewer and indicate anxiety.
* **Practice Self-Control**: Practice managing your nervous habits beforehand to minimize their impact during the interview. Focus on staying calm and composed.

Control Breathing and Pace
--------------------------

* **Deep Breathing**: Practice deep breathing techniques to help you stay calm and manage any anxiety or nervousness that may arise.
* **Speak at a Moderate Pace**: Avoid speaking too quickly or too slowly. Maintain a moderate pace that allows the interviewer to follow your responses without feeling rushed or bored.

Adapt to the Interview Environment
----------------------------------

* **Mirror the Culture**: Adapt your nonverbal cues to align with the company's culture and the interviewer's style. Observe and adjust your energy level, gestures, and overall demeanor accordingly.
* **Respect Personal Space**: Respect the interviewer's personal space by maintaining an appropriate physical distance. Invading personal space can make others feel uncomfortable.
