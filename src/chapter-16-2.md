* Dress professionally: Treat the video interview as you would an in-person interview and dress accordingly.
* Set up your environment: Choose a quiet, well-lit room with minimal background distractions.
* Test your equipment: Make sure your internet connection is strong and the video and audio quality is clear.
* Look into the camera: Maintain eye contact by looking into the camera rather than at the screen.

Artificial Intelligence Interviewing

Artificial intelligence (AI) is being used more frequently to screen job candidates. AI-powered software can analyze resumes and even conduct initial interviews with candidates using chatbots. Here are some tips for acing an AI interview:

* Be brief and concise: Keep your responses short and to the point. AI-powered software is designed to scan for specific keywords and phrases.
* Be aware of tone: Some AI-powered software can detect tone of voice and facial expressions, so be mindful of how you come across.

Virtual Reality Interviewing

Virtual reality (VR) is another emerging technology that's being used to assess job candidates. VR interviews allow employers to simulate real-life situations and assess how candidates react under pressure. Here are some tips for acing a VR interview:

* Research the company: Find out as much as you can about the company and its culture so you can demonstrate your understanding during the VR interview.
